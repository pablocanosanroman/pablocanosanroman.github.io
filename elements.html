										<h3 class="major">Explanation of the game</h3>
										<p>The game starts with a Start Screen composed by a black background and the title of the game. In order to go to the game screen, the user will have to press spacebar.</p>
										
										<p>After pressing space, the game screen will appear and you will see Mario and Luigi at the bottom of the level and a level like the original Mario Bros, with the POW block on the middle of the screen, 2 pair of pipes at the top and bottom of the map, and some coins displayed along the level. Also, at the top of the screen there are two 0, which determines the points that each player has.</p>
										
										<p>The user will be able to move Mario with WASD, or Luigi with the arrow keys, this allows the game to have 2 players. The players will be able to hit the POW block 3 times before it disappears, hitting it will give the player the opportunity of killing the koopas for a certain amount of seconds, if the player goes over them.</p>
										
										<p>Killing these koopas will give the player that has kill them 300 points for each koopa and 200 for each coin collected, increasing the numbers at the top of the screen depending on which player has killed the koopas or collected the coins.</p>
										
										<p>The objective of the game is to survive the wave of enemies taking as much coins as possible. The wave of enemies will consist in 2 invincible goombas that the user/users will have to dodge and 6 pairs of koopas that can be killed by hitting the POW block and touching them afterwards.</p>
										
										<p>The enemies will follow a certain path going from the top pipes to the bottom ones. If all the enemies reach those pipes without killing both players, then the player/players would win and a Win Screen would appear, and the user will have to press Y to restart the game.</p>
										
										<p>Alternatively, if the character is touched by an enemy that doesnt have the POW block effect applied, the character will die, and if both players die, then the game will end and a restart screen will pop up. The player will have to press R to restart the game</p>
