									<h3 class="major">Explanation of the game</h3>
									
									<p>The first thing you see when you run the game is the Start screen, which is composed by a black background and red text in the middle of the screen saying: “PACMAN Press Spacebar to start the game”.</p>

									<p>After pressing the Spacebar, the game will start, drawing Pacman in one specific position, 100 munchies in random positions, 4 red ghosts and 4 yellow ghosts in random positions too. Then, the game theme will start to sound as well as the Pacman movement sound. All the sprites will be animated, and the ghosts and Pacman will have movement. Also, you will be able to see all the time the coordinates of Pacman, the number of lives that you have and the munchies that you have collected.</p>
									
									<p>Every time Pacman collect a munchie, a sound will be played. When the cherry is collected a different sound will be played. Also, when pressing R, you can change cherry position randomly. You can pause the game by pressing P. When P is pressed, a new screen with a transparency will came out, and in the middle of it will put “PAUSED!” in red text. The animations will be stopped, but you will still be able to hear the game theme and the Pacman movement sound. </p>
									
									<p>Every time you get hit by a ghost, their position will change randomly and if you get hit 3 times, the game over screen will came out. This screen is composed by a transparency, as well as in the pause screen, putting in the middle of the screen a red text that says: “GAME OVER! Press Y to restart the game”. If you press Y, the game will restart, letting the player to play again. </p>
									
									<p>If you get all the munchies and cherry of this level it will come out a new menu saying “CONGRATULATIONS! YOU WON! Press I to play again”. If you press I in this screen, the game will be restarted as well as with the GAME OVER screen. </p>
									
									<p>You can put the game in full screen to see the game bigger, but you will have to restart the game to put all the munchies and cherry in all the full screen.</p>
